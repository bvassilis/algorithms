Depth-first

Pre-order:
Visit the root.
Traverse the left subtree.
Traverse the right subtree.

In-order (symmetric):
Traverse the left subtree.
Visit the root.
Traverse the right subtree.

Post-order:
Traverse the left subtree.
Traverse the right subtree.
Visit the root.


Breadth-first
level-order, where we visit every node on a level before going to a lower level.
